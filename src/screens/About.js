          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I’m Shahabaz Khan, a front-end engineer from Hyderabad, India, with over 6 years of
            experience building scalable, high-performance web applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            I specialize in creating clean, responsive, and pixel-perfect interfaces that strike
            a balance between thoughtful design and strong engineering. My focus is on
            accessibility, usability, and performance—ensuring that every experience I deliver
            is both intuitive and reliable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, I’ve grown from writing code to mentoring developers, leading teams,
            and shaping workflows that drive successful project outcomes.
